    <p><strong>Operational logics and playable models</strong> are names for aspects of games that shed light on two related questions: <i>What are the fundamental ways games work?</i> and <i>How can games be about something?</i> "Operational logics" describe a level that is both more specific than common game mechanics (such as "jump" and "shoot") and also cuts across them. These combinations of abstract processes and communicative roles are approached in a number of ways in our work, including as a lens for critical interpretation, a set to be cataloged, and as a foundation for technical research. "Playable models" describe how games create procedural representations of things that happen in their worlds, of which operational logics are primary building blocks. In our work we have looked at playable models of a number of domains, from continuous space to combat.</p>

    <p><strong>Proceduralist readings</strong> are close readings of games that emphasize the representational power of a gameâ€™s rules and processes.</p>

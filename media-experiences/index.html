title: Media Experiences
---
<section>
  <p>This area of EIS work focuses on design research toward new genres of audience experience. We believe new technologies, tools, and design approaches for creating computational media are often best understood and evaluated by using them to create novel works of media. This helps establish whether something new has truly been enabled &mdash; and shows at least one example of the audience experiences that are possible. It also reveals issues that tend to remain invisible with projects that only reach the technology or prototype phase. Finally, it also makes it possible to expand the public’s understanding of how computational media can work and what it can be about. The resulting projects take a variety of forms, from pure software to hybrids involving physical materials and live performance. We share this work in a range of ways, from festival and museum showings to public releases.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="http://ice-bound.com/">The Ice-Bound Concordance</a></strong> is an award-winning interactive narrative game where story pieces are fluidly recombined building blocks, and where endings are discovered with the help of a physical printed art book, The Ice-Bound Compendium. This full-color 80-page book drives the game forward as pages are recognized and modified with augmented reality. This novel multi-media experience was created by Aaron A. Reed and Jacob Garbe while they were in EIS. The game’s dynamic narrative system avoids branching paths, instead treating story narrative fragments as flexible "building blocks" that can be assembled and reconfigured based on player exploration and interpretation of different narrative themes. The player's developing relationship with the digital author character affects how the algorithm chooses blocks for the continuing story, part of the lab's ongoing research on experimental interactive narrative technology.

    <p><strong><a href="https://gamecip.soe.ucsc.edu/gamespace">GameSpace </a></strong> is a three-dimensional visualization of 16,000 games on Wikipedia. The visualization uses natural language processing (NLP) machine learning algorithms to position games based on their Wikipedia article text. This is the same process (latent semantic analysis) that was used to derive the GameNet, GameSage, and GameGlobs models, with an additional step that uses t-stochastic neighborhood embedding (TSNE) to provide each game with a three dimensional coordinate in a "galaxy" of games.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://promweek.soe.ucsc.edu/">Prom Week</a></strong> is a next-generation social simulation game driven by a novel artificial intelligence engine. The goal of Prom Week is to make social interactions truly playable. Prom Week uses the AI system Comme il Faut (CiF) to enable rich, emergent storylines by letting players use “social physics.” Just as games like Angry Birds support emergent solutions to physical challenges, Prom Week’s underlying simulation of social considerations (containing over 5,000 rules of social norms and behaviors) allow for emergent solutions to social challenges, like getting geeky Simon a prom date or convincing Buzz to give Monica a second chance. And unlike games like The Sims which use abstractions such as nonsense words or icons to represent language, Prom Week features actual English dialogue, and characters with detailed histories, likes, dislikes, permanent traits, and temporary statuses—all of which can be leveraged by the player to produce just the right prom night story.</p>
    <p>Prom Week can be played on <strong><a href="http://apps.facebook.com/promweek">Facebook</a></strong>.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://www.playablstudios.com/facade">Façade</a></strong> is the first fully-realized interactive drama. Integrating an interdisciplinary set of artistic practices and artificial intelligence technologies, it includes a novel architecture for supporting emotional, interactive character behavior and drama-managed plot. Within this architecture resides a dramatically interesting, real-time 3D virtual world inhabited by computer-controlled characters, in which the player experiences a story from a first-person perspective. <i>Façade</i> has been downloaded more than five million times, widely exhibited, covered in publications such as <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/07/arts/redefining-the-power-of-the-gamer.html">The New York Times</a></i> and <i><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/11/sex-lies-and-videogames/305293/">The Atlantic Monthly,</a></i> and featured in YouTube videos viewed more than 100 million times.</p>

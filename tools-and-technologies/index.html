title: Tools & Technologies
---
<section>
  <p>This area of EIS work focuses on enabling new possibilities for making and understanding media. Much of it builds on our work on analyses and approaches. For example, a computational model of social interaction or of quests might build on our analyses of how those are represented in other forms of media and how they have been modeled in computer games and other computational media. Similarly, a tool for natural language generation or accessible game creation might build on design practices we have studied or explored in other contexts. The technologies that result are often new computational models, enabling new types of computational media experiences. But they can also include technologies that do things like automatically create game maps from emulator play or that extract knowledge about build orders from RTS gameplay logs. The tools we create often aim to allow a broader audience to use our novel technologies to create new types of media. But we also create tools for tasks related to computational media, such as discovering relevant examples from the history of computer games or performing software studies analysis grounded in the operations of the software.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="http://tracery.io/">Tracery</a></strong> is an approachable text generation tool and language by Kate Compton. It's been used by middle school students, humanities professors, indie game developers, professional bot makers, and lots of regular people, too. Among other things, it's the language behind <a href="https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/">Cheap Bots, Done Quick!</a>, which has been used to make a whole bunch of playful and artful Twitter bots.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://www.jamesryan.world/projects#/expressionist/">Expressionist</a></strong> is an authoring tool for text generation in games by James Ryan. Influenced by Kate Compton's Tracery, Expressionist is intended for non-procedural authors and utilizes generative grammars, which yield huge amounts of content with relatively little authoring effort. Where this tool diverges from Tracery is in its tagging affordance: authors can attach tags to chunks of content, and whenever chunks are used to build larger units of content, the result comes packaged with the tags of all the components. This ends up being powerful in two ways. First, it enables content understanding: generated content now comes packaged with author-defined tags about things that matter in the author's game, which means that the computer can actually understand that content and do something accordingly (e.g., use its tags to update the game state). Second, it enables targeted generation: a game engine can request the kind of content it wants by specifying the tags that the content should come packaged with upon being generated.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://gamecip.soe.ucsc.edu/node/54">GameSage </a></strong> is a tool that takes free-text input describing an idea for a videogame and lists the existing games that are most related to that idea. This tool utilizes the notion in LSA of folding in, whereby a new document that was not used during model training is fitted with a representation in the semantic space derived by the model. By treating the user’s input text (which specifies her game idea) as a corpus document (on par with the videogame Wikipedia articles we used to train our LSA model) and folding it in, we are able to derive an LSA vector for the idea. From here, we determine which existing games (from among GameNet’s 11,829 games) are most related to the game idea by using cosine similarity, just as we did in constructing GameNet.</p>

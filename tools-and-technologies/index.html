    <p><strong><a href="http://tracery.io/">Tracery</a></strong> is an approachable text generation tool and language by Kate Compton. It's been used by middle school students, humanities professors, indie game developers, professional bot makers, and lots of regular people, too. Among other things, it's the language behind <a href="https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/">Cheap Bots, Done Quick!</a>, which has been used to make a whole bunch of playful and artful Twitter bots.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://www.jamesryan.world/projects#/expressionist/">Expressionist</a></strong> is an authoring tool for text generation in games by James Ryan. Influenced by Kate Compton's Tracery, Expressionist is intended for non-procedural authors and utilizes generative grammars, which yield huge amounts of content with relatively little authoring effort. Where this tool diverges from Tracery is in its tagging affordance: authors can attach tags to chunks of content, and whenever chunks are used to build larger units of content, the result comes packaged with the tags of all the components. This ends up being powerful in two ways. First, it enables content understanding: generated content now comes packaged with author-defined tags about things that matter in the author's game, which means that the computer can actually understand that content and do something accordingly (e.g., use its tags to update the game state). Second, it enables targeted generation: a game engine can request the kind of content it wants by specifying the tags that the content should come packaged with upon being generated.</p>
